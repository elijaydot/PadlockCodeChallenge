# Padlock Challenge

This is a set of challenges where you have to write a program to determine the code for a padlock based on a given hint. The padlock code is a 3-digit number that you have to calculate using your program. Once you have the code, you can try to unlock the padlock using it.

# Challenges
There are 5 challenges in total, each with a different hint for calculating the padlock code. Here are the hints for each challenge:

## Padlock Hint for Challenge 1
Here is the [Rubric #1]("www.101computing.net/padlock-code-challenge-1/") to the project.
code = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + â€¦ + 38 + 39 + 40

## Padlock Hint for challenge 2
Here is the [Rubric #2]("www.101computing.net/padlock-code-challenge-2/") to the project.
code = Total number of 3-digit combinations where digit1 < digit2 < digit3
e.g. 123 and 358 count as valid combinations whereas 321 or 011 are invalid combinations.

## Padlock Hint for challenge 3
Here is the [Rubric #3]("www.101computing.net/padlock-code-challenge-3/") to the project.
code = Total number of 3-digit combinations where digit1, digit2 and digit3 are all even numbers
e.g. 024 and 886 count as valid combinations whereas 124 or 456 are invalid combinations.

## Padlock Hint for challenge 4
Here is the [Rubric #4]("www.101computing.net/padlock-code-challenge-4/") to the project.
code = Total number of 3-digit combinations where the sum of all three digits (digit1 + digit2 + digit3) is an odd number
e.g. 034 and 555 count as valid combinations whereas 123 or 468 are invalid combinations.

## Padlock Hint for challenge 5
Here is the [Rubric #5]("www.101computing.net/padlock-code-challenge-5/") to the project.
code = Total number of 3-digit combinations where at least two digits are equal.
e.g. 030 and 558 count as valid combinations whereas 123 or 468 are invalid combinations.
